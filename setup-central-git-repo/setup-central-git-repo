1. Initialize a bare repository in a directory (repo)
git init --bare --shared cicd.git

2. create a common group (devops) and add all people(termcap,user1,user2) who will be pushing into it
chgrp -R devops

3. login as the user (termcap) and clone the repo
git clone ssh://localhost/repo/cicd

4. When pushing simply push as
git push origin master (you will be asked for password of termcap)

Notes: use certs to avoid entering passwords each time
